Recently I have been working on an un-published (at this time) blog post that will look at how securekernel.exe and ntoskrnl.exe work together in order to enable and support the Kernel Control Flow Guard (Kernel CFG) feature, which is enabled under certain circumstances on modern Windows systems. This comes from the fact that I have recently been receiving questions from others on this topic. During the course of my research, I realized that a relatively-unknown topic that kept reappearing in my analysis was the concept of Normal Address Ranges (NARs) and Normal Address Table Entries (NTEs), sometimes referred to as NT Address Ranges or NT Address Table Entries. The only mention I have seen of these terms comes from Windows Internals 7th Edition, Part 2, Chapter 9, which was written by Andrea Allievi. The more I dug in, the more I realized this topic could probably use its own blog post.
